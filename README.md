# Workspace Configuration Files

This repository contains my personal configuration files (dotfiles) for various development tools and applications I use daily. It's an ever-evolving collection of settings, shortcuts, and customizations that optimize my development workflow.

## What's Inside

This repository includes configurations for:

- [ ] **Zsh**: Shell configuration and custom aliases
- [ ] **Neovim**: Modern Vim-based text editor setup with plugins
- [ ] **Git**: Global Git configuration and aliases
- [ ] **Homebrew**: Bundle file with my essential packages
- [ ] **Vim**: Traditional Vim editor configuration
- [ ] **Tmux**: Terminal multiplexer configuration

## Installation

**⚠️ Important**: These are my personal configuration files. While you're welcome to use them, please review the code before installing anything. I strongly recommend copying only the parts you understand and need rather than blindly using the entire configuration.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/workspace.git ~/.workspace

# Create symbolic links (example)
ln -s ~/.workspace/zsh/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
ln -s ~/.workspace/nvim ~/.config/nvim
# ... add more symlinks as needed
```

## Disclaimer

These configurations are provided "as is", without warranty of any kind. They are constantly evolving as I discover better ways to work and new tools. While I strive to maintain them well, I make no guarantees about their stability or suitability for your needs.

Use at your own risk. I am not responsible for any issues that may arise from using these configurations.

## Updates

I update these configurations regularly as my workflow evolves. Feel free to watch this repository for updates or check back periodically.

## Contributing

While this is primarily my personal configuration, I'm open to suggestions and improvements. Feel free to:
